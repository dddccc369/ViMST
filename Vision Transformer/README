1. In our paper, the Vision Transformer should be executed initially to obtain the image-gene expression co-representation. Following this, the resulting output features should be concatenated with the spot embeddings. Finally, run the TransformerST to achieve clustering and enhanced gene expression analysis.
2. Execute the command python3 main.py to train and evaluate the model, save the resultant output features, and subsequently concatenate these features with the spot embeddings.
